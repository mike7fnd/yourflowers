# **App Name**: Stillflowers

## Core Features:

- Flower Selection: Browse a grid of flower images, each with a name and short emotional meaning, to select one flower as the primary message anchor.
- Message Input (Optional): Write a short, optional message to accompany the selected flower, with a character limit to preserve emotional restraint. The LLM tool could be used to suggest thoughtful sentiments based on the chosen flower's symbolism and the message itself.
- Delivery Type Selection: Choose between three delivery options: Private Flower (unique link), Garden Flower (public garden), and Timed Flower (future date).
- Private Flower Delivery: Generate a unique link for the recipient to view the flower and message. The recipient can optionally send a flower back or save privately.
- Public Garden View: Display flowers and message previews in a calm, scrollable space, promoting contemplation rather than performance. Provide an option to save flowers privately.
- Personal Space (Private Garden): Each user (even anonymous) gets a private garden to store sent, received, and saved public flowers, with no notifications unless enabled.
- Safety and Emotional Boundaries: Implement protections: message length limit, rate limiting per IP/session, report option, and keyword filtering.

## Style Guidelines:

- The flower images are of primary importance in this design, as emotional anchors; the color palette is built around concepts of love, forgiveness, admiration, and remembrance. As such, we will use a light color scheme to amplify feelings of peace.
- Primary accent color: Pink (#FF5A5F) used in key UI elements.
- Background color: White (#FFFFFF) used extensively for backgrounds and negative space.
- Text and icons color: Softened black (#222222) rather than pure black.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif font, provides an elegant and intellectual feel that enhances the contemplative mood of the app.
- Use minimalist flower icons to represent each flower type.
- Use a grid layout for flower selection, prioritizing image display. Message input fields should be clean and simple.
- Employ gentle transition animations, such as a flower softly fading into a garden or envelope, to enhance the emotional experience.
